# ShellCheck configuration for automation-scripts repository
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/Ignore

# Set minimum severity level
# error, warning, info, style
severity=warning

# Enable optional checks
enable=all

# Disable specific checks that don't apply to our use case
# SC2312: Consider invoking this command separately to avoid masking its return value
# (We use pipefail consistently so this is safe)
disable=SC2312

# Shell dialect (bash for all our scripts)
shell=bash

# External sources
# Allow shellcheck to follow source statements
external-sources=true

# Common excludes for our patterns:
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (when they're runtime determined)
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (often used in sourced scripts)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values (style preference)
# Add these as needed based on codebase patterns

# Note: Individual scripts can override with inline directives:
# shellcheck disable=SC2034  # for specific lines
# shellcheck source=/dev/null # when source path is dynamic
